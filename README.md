pros:
the code is simple and clear,
the code supports basic arithmetic manipulations: multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, the module also has the functions abs, sqrt, power, round.
there are hints that request information,
cons:
work with trigonometric functions is not implemented and log , ln ,
also the history is saved only within one session. After closing the program, the history is lost.
work with fractional numbers in the form of fractions (for example, 1/2 instead of 0.5) is not implemented.
if the expression contains extra symbols, for example (5+b+3), the program will not work correctly

what problems arose: It was difficult to implement the processing of brackets, especially if they are nested several levels deep.                   
It took me a while to get the error handling right so that the program would not end with an error, but would display a clear message.          
I don't have enough knowledge to make a graphical interface yet, but I plan to study this in the future.
